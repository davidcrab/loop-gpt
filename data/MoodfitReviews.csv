The fact that it‚Äôs free and you have access to almost every feature without holding back the most important things that will truly help a person truly shows that those who made this care about others genuinely. Unlike meditation and other self-help apps that charge exorbitant amounts of money they are able to positively effect those who are searching for, and need, the help they deserve but can‚Äôt afford it. I am truly grateful I live in a world where I know developers like this exist and it gives me hope that there are more out there that still aim to use technology to reach out and help others, not just make a profit.

The primary reason why I am giving this four stars instead of five stars Hass to do with the accessibility with voiceover. Voiceover is an accessibility service that changes how the device works to help blind and visually impaired people like me use the touchscreen. In order for voiceover to work well, the app and the interface Hass to be programmed right. Don't get me wrong, because I do think this is one of the most accessible apps for mood out there, but it is lacking a couple of things with voiceover accessibility. For example, when I try to customize the days for a reminder, voiceover does not give me any indication of which days are checked off. For the days that are checked off for the reminders, why not have voiceover say something like M selected or M checked? That would give blind and visually impaired users an indication that Monday is checked off. Otherwise, everything else about this app is great. If it wasn't for the voiceover accessibility problem, then I would give this five stars.",4,False,KNE06482,"Love this app but, ‚Ä¶"

I can‚Äôt believe all of the options of featured this app has yet its not complicated or time consuming. Which is the last thing I need when I‚Äôm feeling fatigued, depressed, and/or overwhelmed!! Also, the BEST THING I LOVE ABOUT THIS AND I HAVE NOTICED THAT THIS APP HAS OVER TIME HELPED AND IMPROVED MY DEPRESSION BY ALWAYS SENDING ME A POSITIVE PERSONAL MESSAGE IN MY NOTIFICATIONS!! I‚Äôve dealt w chronic depression over half my life w episodes lasting up to 6-7 years at a time. So, I‚Äôve at one time long ago tried all the different meds, doctors, self help books, and self medicating. All of it was a horrible experience which is what lead me to the eventually self medicating. I went into recovery 11 years ago and it was the best thing anyone could ever do. That‚Äôs not to say I haven‚Äôt had relapses of depression since then. However, no relapse of self medicating since then while living as life shows up w marriage, motherhood, careers, sudden loss of my very healthy still pretty young mom while at the same time dealing w major layoffs at my old job w a new husband and baby. LIFE IS JUST HARD!! This APP HAS BECOME ONE OF MY FAVORITE TOOLS BECAUSE I GET NOTIFICATIONS THAT ALWAYS SURPRISE ME W A POSITIVE MESSAGE. No, I don‚Äôt use it on a daily basis like set out to do when I set it up w my goals and if your depressed I‚Äôll let you know right now you will most likely never achieve your set out daily goals or you wouldn‚Äôt be struggling in the first place. My disease likes to keep me in denial and mask my depression. Therefore, it works hard at keeping me too fatigued, unfocused, impatient, and feeling too irritable to get a lot of things done. That‚Äôs why I love this app!! If I don‚Äôt accomplish anything I‚Äôm not beating myself up or getting beat up by a notification reminding me I‚Äôve forgotten another task I intended to do or a notification asking me to set the timer to snooze for another hour to work on my goal. INSTEAD, IT SENDS A POSITIVE MESSAGE W A COUPLE OF HAPPY FACES STATING SOMETHING TO DO W HOPE OR SOME INSPIRATION!! I guess you‚Äôll have to try it
